**[COMPOSIO MIGRATION 2026-05-08 — Rube EOL bridge]** All MCP routing on this task is pinned to the native Composio Platform connector (`mcp__8a611864-5cda-497f-baf9-6d3c02ab3404__COMPOSIO_*`), NOT the legacy Rube namespace (`mcp__d6315173-234c-4e6c-bea7-7f5e15d2bde5__RUBE_*`). Tool slugs (`OUTLOOK_SEND_EMAIL`, `OUTLOOK_CREATE_DRAFT`, `OUTLOOK_CREATE_ME_EVENT`, `HUBSPOT_*`, etc.) are byte-identical between stacks; only the MCP server prefix changes. Use the Composio path for Outlook (mail + calendar) and HubSpot. ORA does not use Google Workspace — no GCal/GSheets routing applies. (Notion writes can continue to use the native `mcp__c5f4869f-...__notion-*` MCP; QuickBooks reads can continue to use the native `mcp__52fa80c0-...` MCP.)

Run ORA Artifact Staleness Scan.

Process:
1. List all artifacts via mcp__cowork__list_artifacts.
2. For each artifact, read the HTML at the path field.
3. Look for embedded "last updated" or "data as of" timestamps.
4. For artifacts that pull from connectors (Notion, HubSpot, QuickBooks), do a small probe call to verify the data shape matches what the artifact expects.
5. Flag any artifact where:
   - Last refresh is >7 days old (data drift risk)
   - Connector probe returns errors (broken artifact)
   - Embedded data references entities that no longer exist (e.g., closed deals still showing as active)

Output:
- Email to ggoldberg@oxfordra.net from ggoldberg@ via Outlook.
- Subject: "ORA Artifact Staleness Scan — [Date]".
- Body: artifact name, last-updated timestamp, status (Fresh / Stale / Broken), recommended action.
- For Broken artifacts: prefix subject [ACTION REQUIRED].

## Publication Guard (v1.1) — REQUIRED for all Notion writes in this skill

This skill follows the v1.1 publication-guard pattern documented at `C:\Users\Owner\OneDrive - Oxford Capital Partners (1)\Documents\Claude\Scheduled\_shared\PUBLICATION_GUARD.md`. Apply these five steps every time this skill calls `notion-create-pages`. This guard SUPERSEDES any prior in-body instructions to "log failure inline" or "do not retry more than once" — those were v1.0 conventions and are now obsolete.

1. **Capture** — invoke `notion-create-pages(parent=…, pages=[…])`. Capture `response.pages[0].id` as `publishedId` and `.url` as `publishedUrl`.
2. **Retry once** — if `publishedId` is null, undefined, an error code, or the response itself errored, retry the same `notion-create-pages` call exactly ONCE. Do not loop.
3. **Search-verify** — call `notion-search(query=<literal title used in Step 1>, filters={created_date_range: {start: today, end: today+1}})`. Confirm the returned page ID matches `publishedId`. If no match or different ID, treat as publication failure → Step 4.
4. **Outlook fallback (auto-send)** — IFF Steps 1+2+3 all failed, AUTO-SEND via Composio `OUTLOOK_SEND_EMAIL` with `account_id="outlook_icaco-sequel"`, `to="ggoldberg@oxfordra.net"`, `subject="❌ ora-artifact-staleness-scan PUBLICATION FAILED — <YYYY-MM-DD>"`, body containing what the page WOULD have contained verbatim, plus the Notion API error verbatim, body_tag `"AUTO-SENT — meta-failure path, no human-in-loop available"`. This auto-send overrides the default "draft, don't send" rule because the skill's audit/monitoring function is meaningless if its publication fails silently.
5. **Failure-mode logging** — append a single line to the skill's chat-summary output: `Publish: [✅ direct | ✅ retry | ❌ fallback-sent | ❌❌ total-blackout]`.
