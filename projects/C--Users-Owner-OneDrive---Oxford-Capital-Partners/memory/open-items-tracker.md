description: "Single canonical open-items / punch-list tracker for the ORA system — one entry per open/residual/TODO item across memory, fleet, and repo state. Other files POINT here; item text lives in exactly one place."

**Purpose:** every open/residual/TODO item anywhere in the ORA system (memory files, `oxford-cc-repo-health.md`-style incident writeups, `event_log.md` follow-ups, fleet punch lists) gets exactly ONE row here. Other files reference an item by pointer — `[open-items-tracker.md#OI-003](open-items-tracker.md#OI-003)` — and never restate its description, evidence, or status inline. A restated copy is the thing that rotted in the 2026-07-16/17 incident (see [[event_log]] and [[oxford-cc-repo-health]]): a forward-pointer to `session-context.md` "carrying the live list" went dead the instant that file's content moved on, because the item text lived in two places and only one of them got updated when the item closed.

**Why a new file, not an existing one:** checked against [memory-policy.md](memory-policy.md)'s fixed 13-doc set first. `ops_decision_log.md` is the closest existing candidate but is scoped to *already-decided* yes/no operational questions (one row per resolved question, answer never changes shape); this tracker is scoped to items with a *mutable open→closed lifecycle* that need to be found and closed, not re-derived. Different purpose, so a new file is the "real new domain" memory-policy.md requires before adding to the set.

## Convention

- **ID:** `OI-NNN`, zero-padded, monotonic, never reused. The ID lives on its own `### OI-NNN` header line so the anchor is stable (`open-items-tracker.md#OI-NNN`) — do not put the title on the header line itself.
- **Fields per item:** `Status` (OPEN / CLOSED), `Opened`, `Closed` (if closed), `Source` (the file/incident that raised it — link, not restated text), `Description` (one line), `Evidence` (closure only — what was actually checked, not "should be fine"), and an optional `Auto-check` line (see below).
- **Pointing in:** any other memory file that wants to mention this item links to `open-items-tracker.md#OI-NNN` and says nothing else about it — no paraphrase, no "as of DATE it's still open," nothing that can drift out of sync with the row here.
- **Closing an item:** flip `Status` to CLOSED, add `Closed:` date and `Evidence:` (what was mechanically checked, with the command/tool used), move it to the Closed table below. Never delete a row (append-only in spirit, same as `event_log.md` — a closed item stays as a record).

### Auto-check (optional, machine-checked)

An OPEN item may carry a single-line `**Auto-check:**` field in a small closed vocabulary that `memory-integrity-probe.py` can evaluate against live `fleet-status.py --json` output — no arbitrary code execution, just a bounded comparison against the dual-fleet scheduled-task registries:

- `kind=registry_disabled_count fleet=<cc|lams|all> expect=<N>` — the count of `enabled:false` tasks in that fleet must equal N for the item to read as resolved.
- `kind=registry_field_equals fleet=<cc|lams> task_id=<id> field=<cron|enabled> expect=<value>` — a named task's field must equal the given value.

When an OPEN item's auto-check matches, the probe emits a WARN (report-only, never auto-closes — a human still confirms and flips the status) on its next scheduled run (`ora-health-guard`, daily 05:15, or `ora-cc-schematic-refresh`, twice weekly). The probe also flags any `open-items-tracker.md#OI-NNN` reference elsewhere in `memory/*.md` whose ID doesn't resolve to a row here (dead pointer) — that one fails hard (matches the existing "orphan index link" severity), since a dead pointer into this file is exactly the failure mode this tracker exists to prevent. Detail: `~/.claude/maintenance/memory-integrity-probe.py`.

### OI-009
**Status:** OPEN (substantial progress made 2026-07-17, real scope remains)
**Opened:** 2026-07-17
**Source:** [project_tenant_db_no_sync_rootcause.md](project_tenant_db_no_sync_rootcause.md)
**Description:** OI-008's sweep for the Escalation-Date/Lease-Expiration column-mapping bug could
only check the 79-pair Notion↔workbook reconciliable overlap (a real workbook counterpart is
required to compare against). 93 live Notion Tenant DB rows have no workbook counterpart at all
(family-join miss, or genuinely off-workbook tenants/vacant slots) and have never been
independently verified against primary lease documents. Gabriel confirmed (2026-07-17, via
AskUserQuestion): worth tracking, low priority — not urgent, likely a future bulk
lease-abstraction pass across ~93 tenants rather than a quick check.
**Progress 2026-07-17 (same session, later): 21 corrections written and verified, plus 2 new
systemic bug classes discovered beyond OI-008's Escalation-Date pattern.**
- **Triage first, cheap wins:** re-joined all 93 `notion_only` rows against the 64 `workbook_only`
  rows by tenant name (not the street-family+unit key OI-003 used, which missed these on
  unit-string formatting) — found 18 "free" matches. 14 already matched the workbook exactly (no
  action). 3 Heritage Pool duplicates were stale cache, already resolved under OI-005. 1 fuzzy
  match (GT Industrial Supply) was untrustworthy, not acted on. Of the ~20 remaining
  no-address/no-status rows, matched the documented fabricated HubSpot-collision phantom batch
  (Gabriel 2026-07-12: "leave the ~18-25 unconfirmed singletons... do not re-triage") — excluded,
  not chased.
- **2 direct lease-date corrections** (workbook `Lease Start`/`Escalation Date` miscopied into
  Notion `Lease Expiration`, same root pattern as OI-008, just outside its 79-pair overlap):
  Columbus Suburban Construction `32b6ecd8-9e59-8169-9c1b-c3407f38ebd5` 2026-09-01→2026-08-31;
  Richwood Equipment Company LLC `32f6ecd8-9e59-8190-ab42-ce4ed3289340` 2026-05-01→2028-04-30
  (confirmed via signed lease).
- **1 real gap surfaced, deliberately NOT filled:** My Autonomous Transportation Co — only an
  unsigned LOI locatable ("this letter is not a contract... neither party intends [it] to
  represent the final agreement"), no executed lease found despite the workbook listing them as a
  fully active $8,212.50/mo tenant. Left Notion's (null) dates alone rather than write from an
  unconfirmed workbook claim.
- **NEW BUG CLASS — address mislabeling:** all 16 rows tagged `Property Address: FVC — Fairground
  Village Center` were never off-workbook tenants at all. "Fairground Village Center, LLC" is a
  landlord/holding entity (confirmed via its 2020 Form 1065 and the PSAs for 7658 Fishel + 401
  Sunburst), not a physical address — whoever entered these 16 rows put the entity name in the
  Property Address field. Real address, confirmed via Airmaster's own signed lease naming it
  directly: **29000 Information Ln — Easton MD**. Corrected all 16 rows' Property Address, then
  cross-checked against a live property-specific rent roll (`RentRoll 10.2025 -- 29000 Information
  Lane.xlsx`, 25 units) plus 2 individually-read primary documents (Airmaster's original lease for
  a tenant-turnover case; Medspeed's Third Addendum, May 2026, for a $4,935.42 rent value that
  matched nothing in this tenant's own history — corrected to $1,750, the addendum-confirmed
  current rate). 15 of 16 fully resolved (address + date); 1 (CURREN SOLUTIONS, INC.) left
  deliberately unresolved — the Oct 2025 roll shows its lease already expired 2025-12-31 with no
  more-current source located, too ambiguous to write without further checking.
- **NEW BUG CLASS — cross-property duplicates:** of an original 8-tenant "Red Branch" cluster, the
  live Red Branch rent roll (April 2026, 13/13 units occupied) contains NONE of their names — all
  13 current occupants were already reconciled in OI-003. Checked 2 tenant names directly against
  Red Branch's lease folder: zero matching lease documents found. Cross-referenced against the
  Information Lane roll instead: **3 of the 8 are exact-rent-match duplicates** of tenants already
  correctly resolved there — Bay Area Exteriors LLC (`32b6ecd8-9e59-8110-8d4e-d2796469eacf`,
  $3,700 = Info Lane Unit 502), Eastern Shore Karate & Fitness LLC
  (`32b6ecd8-9e59-8115-b8fa-f3c924846355`, $1,802.50 = Unit 306), Palmer's Plumbing LLC
  (`32b6ecd8-9e59-8175-ac37-c4485ea0910e`, $2,980.36 = combined Units 301+302, stale dates on the
  Red-Branch-tagged copy). All 3 retired (`Row Retired = __YES__`), verified post-write.
- **Genuinely not yet examined:** Eastern Shore Entrepreneurship Center INC. (name also matches an
  Information Lane tenant — likely a 4th duplicate, not yet retired); PRO REPAIR LLC, Chesapeake
  Communications LLC, Bay-Care Heating & Air LLC, Baltimore Dialysis LLC (Fresenius) — the
  remaining 4 of the original Red Branch 8, no match found yet against Info Lane or Red Branch,
  need individual tracing (PRO REPAIR LLC's contact name pattern suggests it may actually belong
  at 1100 Rarig, a THIRD property — not confirmed). Zettler (8), Northwood (7), Sunburst (3), and
  6 no-address-but-Active tenants (Eurosort, Upgraded Roofing, Childs Play Diesel Performance,
  Gator Roofing, I Dig Ditches, Scarlet Covering) — not yet touched at all this pass.
**Auto-check:** none (not a fleet-registry item).

### OI-012
**Status:** CLOSED
**Opened:** 2026-07-17
**Closed:** 2026-07-17
**Source:** ora-deal-command-board SKILL.md STEP 2 (raised during the 2026-07-17 board run)
**Description:** `ora-deal-command-board`'s STALLED flag keyed on Notion's system last-edited
timestamp (`Last Updated`), which both (a) conflated any edit with real deal progress and (b) froze
when deal work happened off-Notion — on 2026-07-17 the 754 Old SR 74 row false-flagged STALLED (36d)
while its PSA was in active negotiation, purely because `Last Updated` hadn't moved since 6/11.
**Already landed this session (NOT the open part):** added a `Last Activity` DATE property to the
Acquisition Pipeline Tracker (`bcfe4a03-...`, via `notion-update-data-source`); backfilled all 7 open
rows; rewrote board STEP 1/STEP 2 to read `Last Activity` with a `Last Updated` → `createdTime`
fallback chain and to tag any row still running on the fallback. **The open part:** the field is only
authoritative once the deal-touching skills stamp `Last Activity = today` when they act on a tracked
row. Update these 5 (Cowork skills — supervised single-writer pass, verify `git log`/`git status` on
`ora-skills` before editing each SKILL.md): `deal-execution` (PSA turns), `loi-generation` (LOI
sent/countered), `acquisition-underwriting` (screen/underwrite), `deal-comparison`, `owner-outreach`.
Same one-line stamp pattern each. Do NOT add the stamp to `ora-deal-command-board` itself — it is
read-only by charter; a board that stamped activity would reset its own stall clock merely by
surfacing a deal. Acceptance: a deal under active off-Notion work does not flag STALLED; a genuinely
dormant deal still flags at 30d; the board never writes `Last Activity`.
**Progress 2026-07-17 (skills pass executed):** Ground truth on which skills actually WRITE the
tracker corrected the original 5-skill list. Edited + committed the source in `ora-skills`
(authoritative repo, single-writer verified clean before start), branch `board-last-activity-stamp`,
commit `643dd9f`, additive only:
- **loi-generation** — stamps `Last Activity=today` when logging "LOI Out".
- **deal-execution** — new standing "NOTION PIPELINE STAMPING" rule covering PSA generation (WF1),
  inbound-PSA/redline review (WF2A), and closing. This was the actual 754 gap: deal-execution
  previously touched the tracker ONLY at closing, so weeks of live PSA turns never bumped the row.
- **acquisition-underwriting** — stamps when it updates an existing tracker row in-place (it
  primarily logs to the Deal Sourcing Log, not the pipeline tracker, so this is its only tracker write).
- **deal-comparison — NOT edited (scope correction):** it is read-only, never writes the tracker;
  inventing a write just to stamp would be scope creep. Dropped from the stamp list.
**Residuals (why still OPEN):** (1) **owner-outreach — RESOLVED 2026-07-17 (source recovered; needs
no stamp).** It had been orphaned (loadable as `anthropic-skills:owner-outreach` but no source in the
repo/workspace/`~/.claude`/git history). Recovered byte-exact from the live runtime store — invoking
the skill surfaced its base dir `AppData/Roaming/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/skills-plugin/…/skills/owner-outreach`
(the runtime IS on disk, just under a nested session path an earlier `find` missed) — and committed
to `ora-skills` (`owner-outreach/SKILL.md`, v1.0 2026-07-11, desc 1012/1024, commit `5dda2cd`).
Reading the recovered source settled the stamping question: **owner-outreach writes the Notion Owner
Outreach Queue DB (off-market first-touch), NOT the Acquisition Pipeline Tracker — so the
`Last Activity` stamp does not apply to it, same as deal-comparison.** Repo now matches the runtime,
so it was cleared from `_staging/PENDING_REIMPORT.md` (no reimport needed). **Stamping scope is thus
fully resolved:** only loi-generation / deal-execution / acquisition-underwriting write the tracker
and all three are stamped; deal-comparison and owner-outreach correctly excluded. (2) **Deployment not
complete:** the post-commit hook staged all 3 skills in `_staging/PENDING_REIMPORT.md`; going live in
the Cowork runtime needs `package_skills.py` → present `.skill` → **manual Save-skill click** (GUI,
not headless), then `pending_reimport.py clear <skill>`. Until then the Monday
`ora-skill-store-drift-check` will flag repo↔store drift. (3) ~~Branch `board-last-activity-stamp` is
committed locally, not merged to main or pushed — awaiting Gabriel's review/merge.~~ **Stale —
corrected 2026-07-17 (Code-surface verification):** `git branch -vv` on `ora-skills` shows
`board-last-activity-stamp` at `5dda2cd`, identical to `main`; `git log main..board-last-activity-stamp`
returns zero commits (fully merged); `git log origin/main..main` also returns zero commits and
`git rev-parse origin/main main` return the same SHA (`main` fully pushed). The branch is not a
residual — this note was simply stale by the time of closure.
**Progress 2026-07-17 (reimport attempt, blocked):** Re-verified `_staging/PENDING_REIMPORT.md` still
listed all 3 (`acquisition-underwriting`, `deal-execution`, `loi-generation`, pending since
2026-07-17T18:17Z, commit `643dd9f`). Packaged `acquisition-underwriting.skill` successfully via
`package_skills.py` (fresh file confirmed in `_staging/out/`). Then found this machine
(LAPTOP-CSHSCBE6) has **no Claude Desktop app installed** — absent from the computer-use
`request_access` allowlist and from `AppData\Local\Programs`, `AppData\Local\AnthropicClaude`,
`Program Files`, `Program Files (x86)`, and Start Menu shortcuts. Gabriel confirmed (2026-07-17, via
AskUserQuestion): **stop here** — do not guess an alternate app name or assume the Desktop app is on
another device. `deal-execution` and `loi-generation` were NOT packaged (no point building `.skill`
files with the GUI step unreachable). All 3 remain pending; none cleared. **Open part now includes:**
locate which device/session actually hosts the Cowork Claude Desktop app's Save-skill flow before
retrying this residual.
**Closure 2026-07-17 (Cowork session, Desktop app located on the Cowork-hosting machine):**
Re-verified `_staging/PENDING_REIMPORT.md` still listed all 3 skills unchanged (pending since
2026-07-17T18:17Z, commit `643dd9f`) before starting — confirmed no other session had cleared any of
them. Packaged all 3 via `tools/package_skills.py C:\Users\Owner\ora-skills\_staging\out
<skill-name>`, each verified fresh via `get_file_info` immediately after build:
`acquisition-underwriting.skill` (50,017 bytes, 2 entries: SKILL.md + target-markets.json, built
18:42Z), `deal-execution.skill` (42-point QC gate confirmed by the packager, 1 entry: SKILL.md, built
18:45Z), `loi-generation.skill` (2,782,431 bytes, 5 entries incl. the 16-point QC gate and the
condensed LOI template, built 18:46Z). The GUI Save-skill click itself could not be performed by the
agent — computer-use's `request_access` refused control of Claude's own window outright (a hard,
non-overridable guard against an agent operating its own interface/permissions), confirming this
step is manual regardless of session type. Handed off the 3 `.skill` files and import instructions to
Gabriel; Gabriel confirmed all 3 imported ("all done"). On that confirmation, ran
`python tools/pending_reimport.py clear <skill>` for all 3 in sequence — each returned
`pending_reimport: cleared <skill>` — then re-read `_staging/PENDING_REIMPORT.md`: the file no longer
exists (the clear script deletes it once the pending list empties), the definitive zero-pending
state. Stamping scope (loi-generation/deal-execution/acquisition-underwriting) was already committed
at `643dd9f`; only the runtime-cache resync remained, and that is now closed. **Residual outside this
item's scope, not blocking closure — since resolved:** branch `board-last-activity-stamp`'s
merge-to-main-and-push status was flagged as not re-verified this session; separately confirmed later
the same session (`ora-skills` `main` HEAD `5dda2cd` == `origin/main` `5dda2cd` via `git fetch` +
`git rev-parse`) — already merged to main and already pushed, nothing outstanding.
**Auto-check:** none (not a fleet-registry item; closure evidence is the cleared
`pending_reimport.py` runs plus the deleted `PENDING_REIMPORT.md`, both reproducible by re-running
`python tools/pending_reimport.py clear <skill>` — a no-op / "already cleared" result confirms state).

### OI-011
**Status:** CLOSED
**Opened:** 2026-07-17
**Closed:** 2026-07-17
**Source:** [project_bash_guard_indirection_gap.md](project_bash_guard_indirection_gap.md)
**Description:** Found during OI-010's adversarial review, deliberately NOT fixed there to keep that
change scoped to the indirection fix. Both were pre-existing (present before OI-010 touched the
file), false-positive-only (annoyance, not a security gap at the time): (1) `git config --get
core.hooksPath` (a pure read) was denied identically to an actual write — check (d) never
distinguished read from set. (2) `cp .claude/settings.json /tmp/backup.json` (reading FROM the
guard file to back it up) was denied identically to overwriting it — the mv/cp check matched the
guard path anywhere in the segment, not just as the destination, despite its own comment saying
"as an argument (destination)".
**Evidence:** Fixed on `oxford-command-center` `main`, commit `8006a15`. Check (d) now
distinguishes mutation from read: any trailing token after `core.hooksPath`'s position counts as a
value being set (regardless of leading dash — no `--` separator required by real git) UNLESS the
command carries an explicit `--get`/`--get-all`/`--get-regexp`/`--get-urlmatch` flag, where a
trailing token is git's own value-pattern filter, not a value. `--unset`/`--add`/`--replace-all`
and the `-c core.hooksPath=` inline form still always deny. Check (g)'s mv/cp guard now treats `mv`
and `cp` differently: `mv` still denies the guard path in either argument position (source-position
mv removes/neutralizes the file, same severity as `rm`), while `cp` denies only the destination
argument via a new `cpGuardWrite()` helper covering the plain 2-arg form and all 3
`-t`/`--target-directory` shapes (short flag, `=`-attached, space-separated) plus unambiguous
long-option abbreviations. **3 rounds of adversarial review** (mandatory per CLAUDE.md for
`hooks/**` security-gate code) found and fixed 3 real bypasses before landing, each confirmed
against the live hook and then regression-tested: a dash-prefixed `core.hooksPath` value (`git
config core.hooksPath -evilhooks`) defeating the initial read/write classifier; `cp
--target-dir=.claude/hooks/ evil.mjs` (GNU abbreviation) missed by the initial destination-only
detection; `cp --target-directory .claude/hooks/ evil.mjs` (space-separated, real GNU cp behavior)
missed by the round-1 fix. Round 3 found nothing further. 68 tests in `bash-guard.test.ts` (was 64),
full project suite 231 files/2792 tests green, typecheck 0, lint 0. Landed via isolated worktree,
fast-forward merge (matching the OI-010 convention), verified zero collateral impact on the main
checkout.
**Auto-check:** none (not a fleet-registry item; closure evidence is the landed commit above,
externally verifiable via `git log`).

**Source:** [project_bash_guard_indirection_gap.md](project_bash_guard_indirection_gap.md)
**Description:** `oxford-command-center/.claude/hooks/bash-guard.mjs` is a stateless, per-invocation
text scanner with no cross-invocation memory. A two-step disk-persisted indirection — a git alias or
a wrapper script written in step 1, invoked by name in step 2 — defeated all 7 blocked command
classes, whether the two steps were one `&&`-joined command or genuinely separate Bash tool calls.
**Evidence:** Fixed on `oxford-command-center` `main`, commit `60c45ed`. Resolves both indirection
layers into one expanded text every existing check scans: git aliases via `git config --get`
(skipping known builtins), inline `git -c alias.X=value` one-shot overrides, and script content read
through a widened set of invocation forms (sh/bash/zsh/dash/ksh, source/dot, stdin redirection,
direct execution, case-insensitive, quoted paths with spaces) with best-effort positional-parameter
and simple-variable substitution inside that content. Three rounds of independent adversarial review
(3 parallel agents, each personally re-verified) found and fixed real bugs before landing: git global
options (`-c`/`-C`/`--git-dir=`/`-p`/`--no-pager`) breaking alias-candidate detection entirely; an
exponential subprocess-spawn blowup from a plausible chained-alias config (4-8s+ stalls on every
Bash call, fixed via a 16-lookup shared budget); a backtracking-prone lazy regex costing ~10s on a
crafted unterminated-quote payload (fixed via length-bounded `{0,4096}?` matches, applied
consistently including to the pre-existing `sh -c`/`$()`/backtick extraction whose exposure this fix
increased); and a quote-handling bug where substituting a variable inside double quotes left stale
quote characters, hiding the result from the downstream commit-message quote-blanking logic. Proved
several bypasses end-to-end (not just hook-logic-level) before fixing: a git alias genuinely staged
an untracked file via `add -A`; a direct-executable and a variable-built-verb wrapper genuinely
deleted a `data/warehouse` test directory. 59 new/updated tests (regression + adversarial-finding
coverage + timing guards locking in both DoS fixes); full project suite 231 files/2783 tests green,
typecheck 0, lint 0. Landed via isolated worktree, fast-forward merge, verified zero collateral
impact on the main checkout. Accepted, documented limits (same architectural ceiling as OI-007):
arbitrary shell constructs beyond simple literal variable assignment — command substitution,
arithmetic, exported variables, control flow, >3-level nested wrappers, >64KB scripts — are not
resolved, since closing those for real needs the same shift OI-007 used (verify the actual outbound
action/repo state), not another regex. 2 unrelated pre-existing false positives found during review,
deliberately not fixed here to keep scope tight: tracked as [OI-011](#OI-011).
**Auto-check:** none (not a fleet-registry item; closure evidence is the landed commit above,
externally verifiable via `git log`).

**Description:** `ora-autonomy-gate.py`'s Gate 1 (external email) and Gate 2a (oxfordra.net prod
deploy) could be defeated entirely, no override needed, via value/reference indirection (a
variable/file-sourced recipient, a renamed netlify binary, splitting a deploy across two Bash
calls). Not fixable by another regex — needed enforcement moved to the actual outbound action.
**Evidence:** Two enforcement points built, each checking the value AFTER a shell has already
resolved any indirection, so there is no more text left to obfuscate by the time either runs:
  - **Email side** (`~/.claude`, landed on `main`): `hooks/lib/email_send_tier.py` +
    `hooks/lib/check_external_send.py`, invoked by `send-via-outlook.ps1` itself right before
    Outlook COM. Adversarial review found and fixed 3 real bugs pre-landing (a suffix-match
    domain-classification bypass, a PowerShell CLI-argument quote-stripping bug breaking the
    checked/sent value equivalence, and a BOM-encoding bug in the shared token parser). Verified
    via 6+ `-WhatIf` scenarios against the live script, including the exact indirection trick
    (variable-concatenation-built recipient) that defeated Gate 1 — now correctly denied.
  - **Netlify side** (`website-canonical`, PR [#30](https://github.com/ZeOoba/Website/pull/30),
    MERGED by Gabriel 2026-07-17 — merge commit `b25a70d9`): `scripts/netlify-guard.js` +
    `scripts/patch-netlify-shim.js` (postinstall-patches `node_modules/.bin/netlify*` to route
    through the guard). Adversarial review found and fixed 2 real bugs pre-PR (an exact-array
    argv check that let `--prod=true` and the documented `--prod-if-unlocked` flag bypass
    authorization entirely, and a postinstall patcher that silently exited 0 even when zero
    shims were patched). Verified via the wrapper's own dry-run switch across 9+ scenarios,
    including a real `npm install` proving the postinstall hook re-patches a reverted shim, and
    the same indirection trick (shim path + flag built via shell variable concatenation) —
    still caught. Post-merge, confirmed the live site (`oxfordra.net`) renders correctly and
    unaffected (the PR touches only dev tooling, no site content).
**Auto-check:** none (not a fleet-registry item; closure evidence is the merged PR + landed
commits above, both externally verifiable).

**Description:** Purge 2 dangling disabled LAMS scheduled-task entries left over from the fleet-recovery near-misses.
**Evidence:** `fleet-status.py` (run 2026-07-16) — zero disabled entries anywhere in the LAMS fleet. The one fleet-wide disabled task (`check-code-audit-image-pass`) is CC/MCP, unrelated to this item. Nothing was left to purge; the entries had already been cleared by an earlier pass that never logged closure here.

**Source:** [project_tenant_db_no_sync_rootcause.md](project_tenant_db_no_sync_rootcause.md)
**Description:** Add a real `Archived` property to the Notion Tenant DB schema. No native
archive/status field existed — the 2026-07-12 remediation archived rows by title-prefix
(`⛔ ARCHIVED …`) only, so all rows remained live and queryable.
**Evidence:** Added `Row Retired` CHECKBOX property via `notion-update-data-source` (`ALTER
COLUMN`). Both single-word reserved names (`Archived`, `Retired`) failed with `validation_error`
before the two-word name succeeded. Property confirmed live and in active use: 2 Heritage Pool
duplicate rows retired under OI-005 and 1 duplicate `9620 State 350` Unit 110 row retired under
OI-006, all queryable via `"Row Retired" = '__YES__'`.

### OI-003
**Status:** CLOSED
**Opened:** 2026-07-16
**Closed:** 2026-07-17
**Source:** [project_tenant_db_no_sync_rootcause.md](project_tenant_db_no_sync_rootcause.md)
**Description:** Build the Notion Tenant DB workbook mirror: `EXPORT_RentRoll` (137 rows, live
formulas, join key Property+Unit) → Notion Tenant DB (172 rows), extending
`ora-master-workbook-ingest`. Spec:
`Claude_Workspace/01_Workspace/outputs/2026-07-16_TenantDB-Workbook-Mirror_Spec_v01.md`.
**Evidence:** Live pull of both sides (`export_rentroll.json`, `notion_tenants_raw.json`) joined
via a street-family bucket key (plain naive property-string normalization produced an implausible
117/148-orphan result on the first attempt — rebuilt with the family-bucket approach, see
[[reference_tenant_db_no_sync_rootcause]]). Result: 23 match, 7 workbook-newer, 0 notion-newer, 49
conflict (mostly a `date:Lease Expiration:start` NULL artifact — Notion's field genuinely empty on
most active rows, not a real mismatch), 64 workbook-only, 93 notion-only. Report posted to Notion
page `3a06ecd8-9e59-81d2-9e71-d630fcc5b448`. Per the spec's own mandate, this run was report-only —
no blind overwrite; the confirmed corrections it surfaced were executed individually under OI-005
and OI-006 once each was checked against its executed lease.

### OI-005
**Status:** CLOSED

**Description:** Dedup the two stale Notion `Heritage Pool Supply` rows (both dated 2026-09-30)
against the correct `SRS Distribution / Heritage Pool Supply` row (2031-09-30 — confirmed by
Gabriel 2026-07-16 and matched by the corrected Master Workbook).
**Evidence:** Correct row `32b6ecd8-9e59-8115-9c01-fe0126f3f4b7` left untouched. Two duplicate rows
(`32c6ecd8-9e59-8125-979b-cafe5e648089`, `32b6ecd8-9e59-8161-ab6b-ddc6b708e464`) set to `Row
Retired = __YES__` via `notion-update-page`, verified by fresh SQL query post-write. Separately
flagged (not part of this item's scope): Heritage Pool's `Monthly Rent` ($8,540) vs. its lease
amendment's Year-1 rate ($8,710.80/mo) — **Gabriel ratified $8,540 as correct 2026-07-17**, no
write needed. See [[ops_decision_log]].

### OI-006
**Status:** CLOSED
**Opened:** 2026-07-16
**Closed:** 2026-07-17
**Source:** [project_tenant_db_no_sync_rootcause.md](project_tenant_db_no_sync_rootcause.md)
**Description:** Confirm against the executed lease (Invariant 7) before any mirror write touches
them: 4 tenant-turnover rows (Zettler 2016, 9620 State 350 #110, Morrison 390, Banwick 2814) where
Notion still named the predecessor tenant, plus the Soldier Trucking property conflict (Notion:
2018 Zettler Rd unit 301; workbook: 1100 Rarig G&H).
**Evidence:** Read all 5 primary executed lease documents via SharePoint (`read_resource`) —
Soldier Trucking original lease + Second Addendum (DocuSign-executed, Gabriel Goldberg's own
signature 2026-03-30: confirms 1100 Rarig Ave Unit G&H, $3,183/mo, term → 2026-10-31), Columbus
Diamonds Elite Cheer (2016 Zettler Rd, term 2026-05-01→2029-04-30), Triple Threat Kansas City
(9620 E State Rte 350 Unit 110, Raytown MO), Pact Containers LLC (390 Morrison Rd, term
2026-05-05→2029-04-30), AI Thomas LLC d.b.a. AIT Environmental Technology (2814 Banwick Rd, term
2026-06-01→2029-05-31). All 5 confirmed the workbook/audit's claims exactly. `9620 State 350` Unit
110 turned out to carry 2 duplicate stale Notion rows (both "Square Cow Movers/BHIL Enterprises");
handled with the same keep-one/retire-one pattern as OI-005. Wrote 6 `notion-update-page` calls
(4 turnovers + 1 property-conflict correction + 1 duplicate retirement), verified via a fresh SQL
query by page ID post-write — all 6 rows match the intended values exactly. Page IDs: Soldier
Trucking `32b6ecd8-9e59-8192-9427-c1fcc2e803f3`, Zettler 2016
`32f6ecd8-9e59-8192-8c73-f69c14122253`, Morrison 390 `32c6ecd8-9e59-8171-a432-c8a5adbba8c4`,
Banwick 2814 `32f6ecd8-9e59-8106-b4d9-f6da8fb7cec0`, State 350 #110 kept
`32b6ecd8-9e59-8105-8d7e-ea9a94b603f8` / retired `32c6ecd8-9e59-815b-9a67-da8c147292a7`. Noted, not
flagged as an error: Zettler/Morrison/Banwick all lease under landlord entity "Fairground Village
Center, LLC" at the same Potomac, MD address — a consistent multi-property holding entity, not a
data anomaly.

### OI-008
**Status:** CLOSED
**Opened:** 2026-07-17

**Description:** Sweep every live Notion Tenant DB row's `Lease Expiration` against the workbook's
`Escalation Date` column (not just `Lease End`) to find any rows beyond the 7 already checked where
the original March 2026 import miscopied the wrong workbook column.
**Evidence:** Ran a script (`sweep_escalation_bug.py`) joining every non-archived, non-retired
Notion row against `EXPORT_RentRoll` via the same street-family+unit key used throughout this
reconciliation, flagging any pair where `Notion Lease Expiration == WB Escalation Date != WB Lease
End`. This is the full reconciliable overlap (79 joined pairs — matches OI-003's original
match+workbook-newer+conflict count exactly, confirming no join coverage was lost). **Result: 4
hits, all 4 already fixed** under the OI-003–006 follow-on remediation earlier tonight (TYM
Wholesale LLC/Zettler 2006, Pedro Ulate/4595 5th Ave, SAFE CONNECTION ELECTRIC LLC/Banwick 2824,
Randy's Aquarium Service/Banwick 2804) — the sweep ran against a pre-fix data cache, which is why
they still show as hits in the script output; live Notion already carries the corrected values
(verified under OI-003–006's own evidence). **No new instances of this bug exist anywhere the
comparison is possible.** Scope boundary, not a gap in the sweep: 93 live Notion rows have no
workbook counterpart at all (family-join miss or genuinely off-workbook tenants), so this
column-mapping check cannot apply to them — verifying those 93 independently against primary lease
documents would be a much larger, separate undertaking, not implied by this item's description.
